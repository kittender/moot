# Action cards
These cards are meant to divide responsibilities among players by encouraging volunteering.

* **DO** - "I take this action and will start it right away."
* **TODO** - "I take responsibility for this action and start it as soon as I can."
* **FIX** - "I will research on solutions right away to turn this action into something achievable."
